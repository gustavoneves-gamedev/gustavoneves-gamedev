# 👋 Hi, I'm Gustavo  
### Game Developer · Unity & C# · Solo Dev at **Snows Studios**

I’m a solo game developer passionate about **creating abilities, progression systems and meaningful gameplay loops**.  
Currently studying Digital Games at **PUC Minas (EAD)** and building my portfolio with Unity projects, game jams and experimental mechanics.

I love designing:

- 🌀 wave progression and arena flow  
- 🎯 build-crafting systems  
- 🧩 modular gameplay logic & clean code architecture  
- ✨ gameplay feedback (clarity, impact, progression and rewards)
